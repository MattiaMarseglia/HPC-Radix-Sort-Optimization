Parallelize and Evaluate Performances of "RADIX SORT" Algorithm , by using OpenMP.

ATTENTION: 2-Students Groups HAVE to provide INPUTS from a FILE (that you can generate off-line)

Provide (different if you WANT) solutions to the problem of parallelize "RADIX SORT" ALGORITHM

Your report has to include:

A description of the problem
A description of your experimental setup
The HW you use (CPUs type, Ram, Virtual machines configuration (if any), colab setup (if any) etc. )
The SW you use (Operating system version and main configuration like dimension of Swap files/partition, libraries version, compiler versions, etc. )
Any time you describe a result: compiler configuration and options, workload description, environment variables etc.)
 Performances, Speedup, Efficiency and other considerations
Describe and Motivate your results
Describe different solutions
Describe and motivate your optimal configuration
 A Description of the test cases
your APIs description (if any)
Description on how to setup a system to reproduce (automatically) your results (of course on a different system)
If you use Colab, include the notebook as attachment (do not copy the notebook in the pdf ...)


Provide the source code (makefile, folders etc.) to test and reproduce your results as described in the general section of Final Projects Assignments 

Do not forget to follow the base rules about license agreements
